## sample tracking
```{r echo=F, eval = T, warning=F}
tf <- read.delim("targetFile.txt")

library(DT)
datatable(tf)
```

## Methods
The multiqc html (separate file), summarises the alignment statistics along with the duplication rates, flagstats and other useful quality control metrics pertaining to all samples.
Alignment and qc stats were generated via [bowtie2](https://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml) and [samtools](http://www.htslib.org/doc/samtools.html);

The raw fastq reads were first processed with [fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp) package to:


- Trim for low quality reads;
- 2 color chemistry bias (next-seq);
- Trim for noisy short fragments;
- Trim for adapter sequence;

```{bash echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
fastp --length_required 50 --qualified_quality_phred 20 --trim_poly_g ...
```

The trimmed reads were then aligned to `r params$genome ` reference genome with `r params$annot` annotations;

```{bash echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
    (bowtie2 \
    --no-unal \
    -x ${genomeDirBT2[${DIR}]} \
    -1 $read1 -2 $read2 \
    --threads 12 \
    -S - | samtools view -@ 24 -b -h -F 0x0100 -O BAM -o ${prefix}.bam)2>${prefix}.log
```

These primary bam files were then marked for duplicates using [picard](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/).

Duplicated and MT mapping reads were removed. The filtered (-Duplicated -MT) bams were then used for all downstream analysis.

[MACS2](https://github.com/taoliu/MACS) was used to call peaks on filtered bam files using the following parameters:

```{bash echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
macs2 callpeak -t ${bam} \
        -f BAMPE \
        -n ${name} \
        -g ${genomeSize} \
        -q 0.05 \
        --nomodel --shift 37 --ext 73 \
        --fe-cutoff 5 \
        --keep-dup all
```

## fragmentsDistribution

Post-normalization, the medians should be consistent across samples and more similar between biological replicates.

## sampleCluster
![](figures/cluster.png){width=800px}

An euclidean distance is computed between samples, and the dendrogram is built upon the Ward criterion. We expect this dendrogram to group replicates and separate biological conditions.



## principalComponents

Another way of visualizing the experiment variability is to look at the first principal components of the PCA. On this figure, the first principal component (PC1) is expected to separate samples from the different biological conditions, meaning that the biological variability is the main source of variance in the data.


## MA-Plot

The above figure represents the MA-plot of the data for the comparisons done, where differentially expressed features are highlighted in red. A MA-plot represents the log ratio of differential expression as a function of the mean intensity for each feature. Triangles correspond to features having a too low/high log2(FC) to be displayed on the plot.
